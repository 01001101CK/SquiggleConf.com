	<BodyText
		>SquiggleConf brings web developers together to learn, share, and grow.
	</BodyText>

	<BodyText
		>As a program of Squiggle.Tools, a nonprofit organization, we foster
		community not just at our annual conference, but year-round through
		<EmphasizedText>Boston TS Club</EmphasizedText> and
		<EmphasizedText>Michigan TypeScript Club</EmphasizedText>.</BodyText
	>

	<BodyText
		>We believe tech education should be accessible to all. Each year around
		SquiggleConf, we organize
		<EmphasizedText>volunteering initiatives</EmphasizedText>
		such as teaching local teens to code. And while SquiggleConf tickets have a cost,
		we offer multiple paths to attend for free or at a discount.</BodyText

	SquiggleConf strives to create an inclusive conference that welcomes
	developers from every background- no matter your age, skill level, or career
	path.
